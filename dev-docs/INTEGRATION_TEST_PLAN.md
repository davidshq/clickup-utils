# Integration Test Plan for ClickUp CLI

This document outlines the main needs and approach for implementing integration tests for the ClickUp CLI, focusing on real API usage with the `CLICKUP_API_TOKEN_TEST` environment variable.

## Important Note on Test Status

A test is only considered **implemented** when it runs and passes in the current environment. If a test is skipped or fails due to missing data or configuration, it is **not** considered fully implemented.

---

## 1. Environment Setup âœ… **PASSING**

See [ADR 0004: Integration Testing Strategy](../adr/0004-integration-testing-strategy.md) for detailed implementation information about the integration testing environment setup.

For setup instructions, see [INTEGRATION_TESTS_README.md](INTEGRATION_TESTS_README.md).

---

## 2. Core Integration Test Scenarios

### a. Authentication âœ… **PASSING**
- **Test:** Verify that the CLI can authenticate using the test token and access the API (e.g., fetch current user or workspace).
- **Goal:** Ensure the token is valid and the CLI can make authenticated requests.
- **Status:** Implemented and passing.

### b. Workspace/Team Listing âœ… **PASSING**
- **Test:** Run the CLI to list workspaces/teams and check for a successful response.
- **Goal:** Confirm the CLI can fetch and display workspace/team data.
- **Status:** Implemented and passing.

### c. Task Lifecycle âœ… **PASSING**
- **Test:**
  1. Create a new task in a test list.
  2. Fetch the task and verify its properties.
  3. Update the task (e.g., change name or status).
  4. Delete the task.
- **Goal:** Ensure the CLI can perform full CRUD operations on tasks.
- **Status:** Implemented and passing.

### d. Commenting âœ… **PASSING**
- **Test:**
  1. Add a comment to a test task.
  2. Fetch comments for the task and verify the new comment appears.
- **Goal:** Validate comment creation and retrieval.
- **Status:** Implemented and passing.

### e. Error Handling âœ… **PASSING**
- **Test:** Attempt an operation with an invalid token or on a non-existent resource.
- **Goal:** Ensure the CLI reports errors gracefully and does not panic.
- **Status:** Implemented and passing.

### f. Rate Limiting âœ… **PASSING**
- **Test:** Simulate or trigger API rate limiting (HTTP 429) and verify the CLI handles it gracefully (e.g., retries, user-friendly error message).
- **Goal:** Ensure robust handling of rate limits.
- **Status:** Implemented and passing.

### g. List Operations âœ… **PASSING**
- **Test:** Create, list, show, and delete lists within a space.
- **Goal:** Validate list management functionality.
- **Status:** Implemented and passing.

### h. Invalid Authentication âœ… **PASSING**
- **Test:** Test CLI behavior with invalid or missing authentication tokens.
- **Goal:** Ensure proper error handling for authentication failures.
- **Status:** Implemented and passing.

### i. CLI Basic Commands âœ… **PASSING**
- **Test:** Verify basic CLI functionality like help, version, and invalid command handling.
- **Goal:** Ensure CLI interface works correctly.
- **Status:** Implemented and passing.

## 3. Test Structure & Best Practices âœ… **PASSING**

See [ADR 0004: Integration Testing Strategy](../adr/0004-integration-testing-strategy.md) for detailed implementation information about test structure and best practices.

---

## 4. Loading Environment Variables in Tests âœ… **PASSING**

See [ADR 0004: Integration Testing Strategy](../adr/0004-integration-testing-strategy.md) for detailed implementation information about environment variable loading.

---

## 5. Current Test Implementation Status

> **Note:** Detailed test implementation status has been moved to [ROADMAP_COMPLETED.md](../ROADMAP_COMPLETED.md)

**Current Status:** All integration tests implemented and passing, covering authentication, CRUD operations, error handling, rate limiting, and CLI functionality.

---

## 6. Running Integration Tests

### Using the Test Script âœ… **PASSING**
```bash
# Run all integration tests
./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh

# Run specific test
./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh test_authentication
```

### Manual Execution
```bash
# Run all integration tests (including ignored ones)
cargo test -- --ignored

# Run specific test
cargo test test_authentication -- --ignored

# Run with output
cargo test test_authentication -- --ignored --nocapture
```

## 7. Test Environment Setup

### Required Files:
- `.env.test` - Test credentials (copy from `env.test.example`)
- `CLICKUP_API_TOKEN_TEST` environment variable

### Optional Configuration:
- `CLICKUP_TEST_WORKSPACE_ID` - Specific workspace for testing
- `CLICKUP_TEST_LIST_ID` - Specific list for testing
- `CLICKUP_TEST_SPACE_ID` - Specific space for testing

If optional IDs are not provided, tests will dynamically discover available workspaces, spaces, and lists. If discovery fails, tests may be skipped.

## 8. Current Status & Improvements Needed

> **Note:** Detailed accomplishments and minor issues have been moved to [ROADMAP_COMPLETED.md](../ROADMAP_COMPLETED.md)

### ðŸ“‹ **Potential Enhancements:**
1. **Test Data Isolation:** Add unique prefixes/tags to all test resources for better isolation.
2. **Parallel Test Safety:** Implement `serial_test` for tests that modify shared resources.
3. **Test Reporting:** Add more detailed test output and reporting.
4. **Mock API Support:** Add optional mock API support for faster unit testing.
5. **Performance Benchmarks:** Add performance testing for API operations.
6. **Additional Test Scenarios:** Add tests for file attachments, time tracking, and other advanced features.

---

## 9. Next Steps

> **Note:** Completed next steps have been moved to [ROADMAP_COMPLETED.md](../ROADMAP_COMPLETED.md)

### ðŸ“‹ **Future Enhancements:**
1. Add more comprehensive test scenarios (e.g., file attachments, time tracking)
2. Implement test data cleanup automation
3. Add performance benchmarking tests
4. Implement mock API support for faster testing
3. Add performance benchmarks
4. Create test result reporting and analytics
5. Add integration tests for new CLI features as they are developed
6. Implement test coverage reporting
7. Add automated test result notifications
