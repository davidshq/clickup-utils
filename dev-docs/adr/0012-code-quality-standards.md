# ADR 0012: Code Quality Standards

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The ClickUp CLI codebase had accumulated various code quality issues:
- Unused fields and dead code warnings
- Inconsistent test code patterns
- Documentation test failures
- Format string warnings
- Unnecessary mutable references

These issues made the codebase harder to maintain and indicated potential technical debt.

## Decision

Establish and maintain strict code quality standards:

- **Zero Warning Policy**: Maintain zero clippy warnings at all times
- **Documentation Standards**: Proper doc comment formatting without test attributes
- **Test Code Quality**: Use struct update syntax and remove dead code
- **Consistent Patterns**: Standardize initialization and error handling patterns
- **Regular Quality Checks**: Automated clippy checks in CI/CD pipeline

All code must pass `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features` with zero warnings.

## Consequences

### Benefits
- **Code Quality**: Higher quality, more maintainable code
- **Developer Experience**: Clear standards for contributors
- **Reliability**: Fewer potential bugs and issues
- **Documentation**: Better examples and clearer documentation
- **Consistency**: Standardized patterns across the codebase

### Risks/Tradeoffs
- **Development Speed**: Slightly slower development due to quality requirements
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Need to maintain quality standards across all changes
- **Learning Curve**: New contributors must understand quality standards
- **CI/CD Complexity**: More complex automated quality checks

## Outcomes
- ✅ Zero clippy warnings maintained
- ✅ All documentation tests passing (22/22)
- ✅ Consistent code patterns across the codebase
- ✅ Improved developer experience and code maintainability
