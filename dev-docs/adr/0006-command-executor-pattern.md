# ADR 0006: CommandExecutor Pattern

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The ClickUp CLI codebase needed a standardized approach for command execution across all command modules to:
- Eliminate code duplication
- Ensure consistent error handling
- Provide a uniform interface for all commands
- Enable easy testing and mocking
- Support the repository pattern integration

The architectural analysis identified the CommandExecutor trait as a solution for standardizing command execution.

## Decision

- Define a `CommandExecutor` trait as the standard interface for all command modules
- Implement the trait across all 7 command modules (Auth, Comments, Lists, Spaces, Tasks, Teams, Workspaces)
- Use the repository pattern for data access within command handlers
- Provide utility modules for common functionality (TableBuilder, DisplayUtils, ErrorUtils, RepositoryUtils, TableHeaders)
- Ensure all commands follow the same execution flow and error handling patterns

## Consequences

### Benefits
- **Consistency**: All commands follow the same execution pattern
- **Reduced Duplication**: ~200+ lines of duplicate code eliminated
- **Maintainability**: Changes to command execution logic only need to be made in one place
- **Testability**: Easy to mock and test command execution
- **Extensibility**: New commands can easily follow the established pattern

### Risks/Tradeoffs
- Requires discipline to maintain the pattern across all command modules
- Slightly more boilerplate for new commands

## Outcomes
- ✅ All 7 command modules standardized with CommandExecutor trait
- ✅ ~200+ lines of duplicate code eliminated
- ✅ 30-40% reduction in command file sizes
- ✅ Consistent error handling and execution flow
- ✅ Repository pattern integration completed
