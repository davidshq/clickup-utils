# Test Coverage Analysis

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the current test coverage for the ClickUp CLI application, identifying well-tested areas and gaps that need attention.

## Overview

The ClickUp CLI application now has **test coverage for both core infrastructure, command modules, utility functions, main CLI logic, and the library interface**, covering the main user-facing functionality as well as the underlying API, models, utilities, CLI logic, entrypoint, and public library API.

## Current Test Coverage

> **Note:** Completed test coverage items have been moved to [ROADMAP_COMPLETED.md](../ROADMAP_COMPLETED.md)

### ⚠️ Remaining Test Coverage Gaps

#### Performance Tests
- [ ] Test rate limiting under load
- [ ] Test large data set handling
- [ ] Test memory usage

#### Security Tests
- [ ] Test token handling security
- [ ] Test input validation
- [ ] Test file system security

## Coverage Statistics

> **Note:** Detailed coverage statistics have been moved to [ROADMAP_COMPLETED.md](../ROADMAP_COMPLETED.md)

**Current Status:** ~95%+ test coverage achieved across core infrastructure, command modules, utilities, CLI logic, and library interface

## Recommendations

### High Priority - Remaining Gaps

- Continue to add edge case and integration tests as new features are developed.
- Maintain coverage as the codebase evolves.
- Implement performance and security tests as outlined above.

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Performance Testing
- Add rate limiting under load tests
- Test large data set handling
- Test memory usage patterns

### Security Testing
- Test token handling security
- Test input validation
- Test file system security

## Conclusion

The ClickUp CLI application has achieved comprehensive test coverage across all core components. For detailed coverage information, see [ROADMAP_COMPLETED.md](../ROADMAP_COMPLETED.md).

**Current Focus:** Performance and security testing to achieve full coverage.
