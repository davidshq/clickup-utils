# ADR 0005: Error Handling Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The ClickUp CLI must provide robust, user-friendly, and maintainable error handling for both library and CLI use. The codebase interacts with a third-party API, file system, and user input, all of which can fail in various ways. Good error handling is essential for:
- Debuggability and user support
- Clean separation of concerns
- Consistent error reporting across commands and modules
- Library usability for downstream consumers

## Decision

- Define a comprehensive `ClickUpError` enum using the `thiserror` crate, with variants for all major error types (API, Auth, Config, IO, Network, Validation, RateLimit, etc.).
- Implement `From` conversions for common error types (e.g., `std::io::Error`, `reqwest::Error`, `serde_json::Error`).
- Provide user-friendly error messages for all variants.
- Centralize error handling in the application layer and command modules.
- Ensure all errors are surfaced to the user in a clear, actionable way.
- Document error types and handling strategy in the code and user documentation.

## Consequences

### Benefits
- **User Experience**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Maintainability**: Centralized, consistent error handling
- **Debuggability**: Easy to trace and diagnose issues
- **Library Usability**: Downstream consumers get structured errors
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new error types as needed

### Risks/Tradeoffs
- Slightly more boilerplate for error conversions
- Requires discipline to use error types everywhere

## Outcomes
- ✅ All major error scenarios are covered by the error enum
- ✅ User-facing errors are clear and actionable
- ✅ Error handling is consistent across the codebase
- ✅ Error types are documented and tested
