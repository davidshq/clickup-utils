# ADR 0002: Adoption of the Repository Pattern

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The ClickUp CLI codebase needs a clean abstraction for API and data access to:
- Decouple command/business logic from API details
- Enable easier testing and mocking
- Support future extensibility (e.g., caching, alternate backends)
- Improve maintainability and separation of concerns

The architectural analysis identified the Repository Pattern as a best practice for this purpose.

## Decision

- Define a `ClickUpRepository` trait as the core abstraction for all API/data operations.
- Implement a concrete `ClickUpApiRepository` that wraps the actual API client.
- Use a `RepositoryFactory` to create repository instances based on configuration.
- All command modules and business logic interact only with the repository trait, not directly with the API client.
- The repository trait is async and object-safe, supporting all major ClickUp operations.

## Consequences

### Benefits
- **Decoupling**: Command logic is independent of API details
- **Testability**: Enables mocking for unit/integration tests
- **Extensibility**: Future support for caching, alternate data sources, or API versions
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and single responsibility
- **Consistency**: All data access flows through a single abstraction

### Risks/Tradeoffs
- Slightly more boilerplate for trait and factory
- Requires discipline to keep all data access through the repository

## Outcomes
- ✅ All command modules use the repository abstraction
- ✅ Easy to add new data sources or features (e.g., caching)
- ✅ Improved testability and maintainability
