# ADR 0009: Async Patterns and Error Handling

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The ClickUp CLI codebase needed robust async patterns and error handling to:
- Handle timeouts gracefully
- Provide proper error context for debugging
- Support request tracing for monitoring
- Ensure reliable async operations
- Provide user-friendly error messages

The architectural analysis identified the need for comprehensive async patterns and error handling strategies.

## Decision

- Implement timeout handling with `tokio::time::timeout`
- Add error context with custom error methods
- Implement request tracing with structured logging
- Use proper async cancellation patterns
- Provide comprehensive error context for debugging

## Consequences

### Benefits
- **Reliability**: Proper timeout handling prevents hanging operations
- **Debuggability**: Rich error context makes debugging easier
- **Monitoring**: Request tracing provides visibility into operations
- **User Experience**: Clear error messages help users understand issues
- **Maintainability**: Consistent async patterns across the codebase

### Risks/Tradeoffs
- Slightly more complex async code
- Requires discipline to use timeout patterns consistently

## Outcomes
- ✅ Async timeout handling implemented
- ✅ Error context methods added
- ✅ Request tracing with structured logging
- ✅ Proper async cancellation patterns
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
