# Example: Get all tasks with the "update-auto" tag
# 
# This script demonstrates how to use the clickup-cli to find all tasks
# that are marked with the "update-auto" tag in a specific list.
#
# Note: This uses client-side filtering - all tasks are fetched from the list
# and then filtered locally to show only those with the specified tag.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Install the CLI: cargo install --path .
# 2. Set up authentication: clickup-cli auth set
# 3. Know your list ID (you can find this by listing workspaces, spaces, and lists)

echo "üîç Finding tasks with 'update-auto' tag..."

# Replace "your-list-id" with your actual list ID
LIST_ID="your-list-id"

# Get tasks with the update-auto tag
clickup-cli tasks list-by-tag \
  --list-id "$LIST_ID" \
  --tag "update-auto"

echo ""
echo "‚úÖ Done! All tasks with 'update-auto' tag have been listed above."

echo "üí° Tips:"
echo "   - Use 'clickup-cli workspaces list' to find your workspace ID"
echo "   - Use 'clickup-cli spaces list --workspace-id <workspace-id>' to find your space ID"
echo "   - Use 'clickup-cli lists list --space-id <space-id>' to find your list ID"
echo "   - You can also filter by other tags by changing the --tag parameter"
