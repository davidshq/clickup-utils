# Example: Search for tasks with the "update-auto" tag across all lists in a space
# 
# This script demonstrates how to use the clickup-cli to interactively search
# for all tasks that are marked with the "update-auto" tag across all lists
# in a selected space.
#
# The script will:
# 1. Display available workspaces and prompt for selection
# 2. Display available spaces in the selected workspace and prompt for selection
# 3. Search through all lists in the selected space for tasks with the specified tag
# 4. Display all matching tasks in a formatted table
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Install the CLI: cargo install --path .
