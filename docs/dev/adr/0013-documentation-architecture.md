# ADR 0013: Documentation Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The ClickUp CLI documentation had inconsistent status reporting, outdated information, and lacked a centralized approach to documentation quality. This led to:

- **Confusion**: Different documents reported different status for the same features
- **Maintenance Issues**: Difficult to keep documentation synchronized with codebase
- **User Experience**: Outdated information misled users about current capabilities
- **Developer Experience**: No clear standards for documentation quality

## Decision

Implement a comprehensive documentation architecture:

- **Status Dashboard Pattern**: Centralized status tracking with real-time metrics
- **Documentation Test Strategy**: All code examples must compile and run correctly
- **Quality Metrics Framework**: Standardized quality assessment across all documentation
- **Update Process**: Regular review cycles and automated quality checks
- **Consistency Standards**: Unified terminology and formatting across all docs

All documentation must pass doc tests and maintain accurate status information.

## Consequences

### Benefits
- **Accuracy**: All documentation reflects current codebase state
- **Consistency**: Unified status reporting across all documents
- **Maintainability**: Clear update procedures and quality standards
- **User Experience**: Reliable and up-to-date information
- **Developer Experience**: Clear documentation standards for contributors

### Risks/Tradeoffs
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Regular documentation reviews required
- **Development Speed**: Documentation updates needed for all changes
- **Complexity**: More sophisticated documentation infrastructure
- **Automation Requirements**: Need for automated documentation testing

## Outcomes
- ✅ All documentation tests passing (22/22)
- ✅ Centralized status dashboard implemented
- ✅ Consistent status reporting across all documents
- ✅ Improved user and developer experience
