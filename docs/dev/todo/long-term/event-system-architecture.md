# Event System Architecture for ClickUp CLI

## Overview

This document outlines the event system architecture options for the ClickUp CLI project, explaining why an event system matters and providing implementation recommendations.

## Why Event Systems Matter

### 1. **Extensibility & Plugin Architecture**
- **Current Limitation**: The CLI is monolithic with no way to extend functionality
- **Event System Benefit**: Enables plugin architecture where third-party developers can hook into CLI operations
- **Use Cases**: Custom formatters, additional logging, integration with external tools, custom validation

### 2. **Observability & Monitoring**
- **Current Limitation**: No visibility into CLI operations or performance metrics
- **Event System Benefit**: Provides comprehensive monitoring, debugging, and analytics capabilities
- **Use Cases**: Performance tracking, usage analytics, error monitoring, audit trails

### 3. **Decoupled Architecture**
- **Current Limitation**: Tight coupling between command execution and side effects
- **Event System Benefit**: Separates core logic from cross-cutting concerns
- **Use Cases**: Logging, caching, notifications, analytics without modifying core code

### 4. **Testing & Debugging**
- **Current Limitation**: Difficult to test side effects and integration points
- **Event System Benefit**: Enables comprehensive testing of all system interactions
- **Use Cases**: Mock event handlers, integration testing, debugging complex workflows

## Event System Architecture Options

### Option 1: Simple Event Bus (Recommended for Phase 1)

**Architecture**: In-memory event bus with synchronous/asynchronous event handling

```rust
// Event definitions
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum ClickUpEvent {
    CommandStarted { command: String, args: Vec<String> },
    CommandCompleted { command: String, duration: Duration },
    ApiRequestStarted { endpoint: String },
    ApiRequestCompleted { endpoint: String, status: u16, duration: Duration },
    ErrorOccurred { error: ClickUpError, context: String },
    RateLimitHit { endpoint: String, retry_after: Duration },
}

// Event bus trait
pub trait EventBus: Send + Sync {
    fn publish(&self, event: ClickUpEvent);
    fn subscribe<F>(&self, handler: F) where F: Fn(ClickUpEvent) + Send + Sync + 'static;
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Simple to implement and understand
- Minimal performance overhead
- Easy to test and debug
- Foundation for more complex systems

**Use Cases**:
- Command execution tracking
- API request monitoring
- Error logging and reporting
- Performance metrics collection

### Option 2: Async Event System with Persistence

**Architecture**: Asynchronous event processing with optional persistence

```rust
// Async event bus with persistence
pub struct AsyncEventBus {
    sender: tokio::sync::mpsc::UnboundedSender<ClickUpEvent>,
    handlers: Vec<Box<dyn EventHandler + Send + Sync>>,
    storage: Option<EventStorage>,
}

pub trait EventHandler: Send + Sync {
    async fn handle(&self, event: ClickUpEvent) -> Result<(), EventError>;
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Non-blocking event processing
- Event persistence for audit trails
- Scalable handler architecture
- Better performance for high-frequency events

**Use Cases**:
- Audit logging
- Analytics data collection
- Integration with external systems
- Complex event processing workflows

### Option 3: Plugin Architecture with Event Hooks

**Architecture**: Plugin system with event-based extensibility

```rust
// Plugin trait with event hooks
pub trait ClickUpPlugin: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn version(&self) -> &str;
    
    // Event hooks
    async fn on_command_start(&self, event: CommandStartedEvent) -> Result<(), PluginError>;
    async fn on_command_complete(&self, event: CommandCompletedEvent) -> Result<(), PluginError>;
    async fn on_api_request(&self, event: ApiRequestEvent) -> Result<(), PluginError>;
    async fn on_error(&self, event: ErrorEvent) -> Result<(), PluginError>;
}

// Plugin registry
pub struct PluginRegistry {
    plugins: Vec<Box<dyn ClickUpPlugin>>,
    event_bus: AsyncEventBus,
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Full extensibility through plugins
- Runtime plugin loading/unloading
- Isolated plugin execution
- Rich ecosystem potential

**Use Cases**:
- Custom formatters and output handlers
- Integration with external tools (Slack, Discord, etc.)
- Custom validation and business rules
- Advanced analytics and reporting

## Integration with Current Architecture

### Service Container Integration
```rust
pub struct ServiceContainer {
    config: Arc<Config>,
    repository: Arc<dyn ClickUpRepository>,
    event_bus: Arc<dyn EventBus>, // New
}

impl ServiceContainer {
    pub fn event_bus(&self) -> &dyn EventBus {
        self.event_bus.as_ref()
    }
}
```

### Command Integration
```rust
impl CommandExecutor for WorkspaceCommands {
    async fn handle_command(command: Self::Commands, container: &ServiceContainer) -> Result<(), ClickUpError> {
        let event_bus = container.event_bus();
        
        // Publish command start event
        event_bus.publish(ClickUpEvent::CommandStarted {
            command: "workspace".to_string(),
            args: vec!["list".to_string()],
        });
        
        let start_time = Instant::now();
        let result = match command {
            WorkspaceCommands::List => list_workspaces(repo).await,
            // ... other commands
        };
        
        // Publish command completion event
        event_bus.publish(ClickUpEvent::CommandCompleted {
            command: "workspace".to_string(),
            duration: start_time.elapsed(),
        });
        
        result
    }
}
```

### Repository Integration
```rust
impl ClickUpApiRepository {
    async fn make_request(&self, endpoint: &str) -> Result<Response, ClickUpError> {
        let event_bus = self.event_bus();
        
        event_bus.publish(ClickUpEvent::ApiRequestStarted {
            endpoint: endpoint.to_string(),
        });
        
        let start_time = Instant::now();
        let result = self.api.make_request(endpoint).await;
        
        event_bus.publish(ClickUpEvent::ApiRequestCompleted {
            endpoint: endpoint.to_string(),
            status: result.as_ref().map(|r| r.status().as_u16()).unwrap_or(0),
            duration: start_time.elapsed(),
        });
        
        result
    }
}
```

## Event Types and Categories

### Command Events
- `CommandStarted`: When a command begins execution
- `CommandCompleted`: When a command finishes (success or failure)
- `CommandError`: When a command encounters an error

### API Events
- `ApiRequestStarted`: Before making an API request
- `ApiRequestCompleted`: After API request completes
- `RateLimitHit`: When rate limiting is encountered
- `ApiError`: When API requests fail

### System Events
- `ApplicationStarted`: When the CLI application starts
- `ApplicationShutdown`: When the CLI application shuts down
- `ConfigurationLoaded`: When configuration is loaded
- `AuthenticationChanged`: When authentication state changes

### User Events
- `UserInteraction`: When user provides input
- `OutputGenerated`: When output is displayed to user
- `HelpRequested`: When help is requested

## Implementation Considerations

### Performance Impact
- **Minimal**: Event bus operations are typically <1ms
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking event handling
- **Optional Handlers**: Handlers can be disabled in production

### Memory Usage
- **Event Objects**: Small, typically <1KB per event
- **Handler Storage**: Minimal overhead
- **Persistence**: Configurable storage limits

### Security Considerations
- **Event Data**: Sanitize sensitive information
- **Plugin Security**: Sandbox plugin execution
- **Access Control**: Limit event access based on permissions

### Testing Strategy
- **Event Mocking**: Easy to mock event bus for testing
- **Handler Testing**: Isolated handler testing
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end event flow testing

## Conclusion

An event system is essential for the long-term success of the ClickUp CLI project. It provides the foundation for extensibility, observability, and advanced features while maintaining the clean architecture already established.

The recommended approach is to start with a simple event bus (Phase 1) to establish the foundation, then gradually evolve to more sophisticated systems as needs arise. This incremental approach minimizes risk while providing immediate benefits.

**Next Steps**:
1. Implement Phase 1 (Simple Event Bus)
2. Add basic event handlers (logging, metrics)
3. Integrate with existing command architecture
4. Measure performance impact and user feedback
5. Plan Phase 2 based on real-world usage
